#### In-the-Open

Most of [OpeningDETAILS's](http://openingdetail.com/) projects are conducted out in the open.  That is, during the development of any one project, all team communication and content is hosted [publicly](https://github.com/Openingdetail) (here on GitHub) and is <a href="#license">open source</a>.

Our [about page](http://openingdetail.com/a-little-more-about-us/) provides a more nuanced description of this open approach.
